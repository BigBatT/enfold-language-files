If you have a GitHub account (or do not mind creating one), you can easily submit your translations to us.

1- Please download the repository you have forked and use language files in it instead of language files inside Enfold/lang folder. This way, we are going to minimize the risk of overwriting files. 


3- After uploading your language files inside "lang" folder, click "New Pull Request" button
